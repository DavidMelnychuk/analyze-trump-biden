      "\n",
      "297) These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our prayers. \n",
      "https://t.co/ajYHuY6VN2\n",
      "\n",
      "298) The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives.

      "\n",
      "307) This #WorldPressFreedomDay, support for an independent press at home and around the world matters more than ever. We must vote Trump out this November and assure that attacks on our free press are never again acceptable — especially not in the White House. https://t.co/Ga8zWYphOg\n",
      "\n",
      "308) Trump deflects legitimate questions with attacks. He bullies members of the press, instead of taking responsibility for his failures. His efforts to undermine public confidence in the integrity of reporting violate our core values and threaten our very system of government.\n",
      "\n",
      "309) A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "319) Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. https://t.co/LVzlxWFTAd\n",

      "\n",
      "322) With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions.\n",

      "\n",
      "326) There are nearly 330 million people in the United States — and according to the Trump White House, we've only conducted 5.4 million COVID-19 tests. It's abysmal.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. https://t.co/lVJAcHySwH\n",
      "\n",
      "330) Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.\n",

      "\n",
      "375) No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth.\n",

      "\n",
      "387) We won’t defeat this President by being like him. We’ll win by doing the opposite. Where he seeks to divide us, we’ll connect people. Where he shows cruelty, we’ll show compassion. And when he fights, we’ll fight harder. But we can’t do it without you.\n",

      "\n",
      "102) There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period. https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBt\n",
