Got Trump Data from December 31 2019 (Start of COVID 19) to July 23 2020.


Look up how to use heuristics in classification.
I.e if includes the word Biden in it and negative sentiment then probably
Trump tweet.

reply_count is a premium twitter api feature.

Heuristic: If they tweet about the other and sentiment is negative, probably classify as
trump/biden tweet.

Distribution of positve/negative tweets of biden and trumps.
Count of positve/negative/netural.
Rate of positive/negative/neutral over time of the pandemic.



Trump tweets A LOT more than Biden.
1700 tweets vs 5200 tweets since December 2019.
Mention this in the report. Frequency statistics not as cool then.

Average tweets a day, week, month.

Can use the entire 3200 biden tweet dataset for training. 
The other statistical text analysis will be for during COVID19 pandemic.
